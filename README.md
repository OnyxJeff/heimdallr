**Heimdallr** stands watch over my homelab from the modest hardware of a Pi Zero.

It runs:
- A **Wake-on-LAN script** to boot sleeping devices on command.
- An **uptime logging script** to ping key IPs and log their status to a file or local dashboard.

---

## âš¡ Wake-on-LAN

To wake a device (add your MAC addresses into the script):

```bash
bash scripts/wake-on-lan.sh <device-nickname>
```

---

## ðŸ•’ Uptime Logger
To ping your critical devices every 5 minutes, schedule this via cron:

```bash
bash scripts/uptime-logger.sh
```
Log output is stored in logs/uptime.log or can be adapted to report to an API or dashboard.
